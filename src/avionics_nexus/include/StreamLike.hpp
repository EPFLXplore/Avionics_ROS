/**
 * Custom varient to replace Stream from arduino.hpp.
 *
 * Stream Class comes from Arduino.hpp which is a pain to cross compile. And even it we did do it,
 * you have no control and it just becomes a headache to maintain. So I just did a custom variant that 
 * we can control. Works exactly the same way. Combination of StreamLike and SerialProtocol, read both to understand.
